Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_cloud_run_service.simple-app will be created
  + resource "google_cloud_run_service" "simple-app" {

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:

  + location = "us-central1"
  + name     = "hello-world-app"
  + url      = (known after apply)

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
